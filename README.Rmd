# pmsims: Simulation-based Sample Size Tools for Prediction Models <a href="https://pmsims-package.github.io/pmsims/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" /></a>

**pmsims** is an R package for estimating how much data are needed to develop
reliable and generalisable prediction models. It uses a **simulation-based
learning curve** approach to quantify how model performance improves with
increasing sample size, supporting principled study planning and feasibility
assessment.

The package is fully model-agnostic: users can define how data are generated,
how models are fitted, and how predictive performance is measured. It currently
supports regression-based prediction models with continuous, binary, and
time-to-event outcomes.

Developed at [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) (Department of
Biostatistics & Health Informatics) with input from researchers, clinicians,
and patient partners. See the [pmsims project
site](https://pmsims-package.github.io/pmsims-website/) for further details.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pmsims-package/pmsims")
```

## Minimal example

```r
library(pmsims)
set.seed(123)

binary_example <- simulate_binary(
  signal_parameters = 15,
  noise_parameters  = 0,
  predictor_type = "continuous",
  binary_predictor_prevalence = NULL,
  outcome_prevalence = 0.20,
  large_sample_cstatistic = 0.80,
  model = "glm",
  metric = "calibration_slope",
  minimum_acceptable_performance = 0.90,
  n_reps_total = 1000,
  mean_or_assurance = "assurance"
)
