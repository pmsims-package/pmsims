# pmsims: Simulation-based Sample Size Tools for Prediction Models

pmsims is a flexible, simulation-based toolkit for exploring how much
data are needed to develop reliable prediction models. It works by
repeatedly generating data, fitting models, and evaluating performance
to show how sample size affects stability, accuracy, and overfitting.
The package supports continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes and
can be used with a range of regression-based modelling approaches. It is
designed to help researchers plan studies, assess feasibility, and build
more robust and generalisable models.
