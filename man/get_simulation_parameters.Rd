\title{Get a data frame of sample sizes and reps at each sample size to use in simulation}
\usage{
get_simulation_parameters(
  min_sample_size,
  max_sample_size,
  n_reps,
  n_sample_sizes
)
}
\arguments{
\item{min_sample_size}{The minimum sample size}

\item{max_sample_size}{The maximum sample size}

\item{n_reps}{The total number of simulation reps}

\item{n_sample_sizes}{The number of different sample sizes to run simulations on}
}
\value{

}
\description{
get_simulation_parameters returns a data frame with the first column
containing different sample sizes and the second the number of reps to run
at each sample size. The sample sizes are equally spaced between the min and
max sample sizes. The number of reps is the total number of simulation reps
divided by the number of different sample sizes to run simulations on.
