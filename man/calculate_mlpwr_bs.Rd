\arguments{
\item{test_n}{The sample size used for test datasets. This should be a large number.}

\item{n_reps_total}{The total number of simulation reps run by pmsims.}

\item{n_reps_per}{The number of reps run at each sample size.}

\item{se_final}{A standard error which can be used as a stopping criteria. Either n_reps_total or se_final should be given.}

\item{min_sample_size}{The minimum sample size assessed. This sets the lower bound of the search region for sample size.}

\item{max_sample_size}{The maximum sample size assessed. This sets the upper bound of the search region for sample size.}

\item{target_performance}{The minimum desired model performance}

\item{mean_or_assurance}{Can be either "mean" or "assurance". If mean, sample size is calculated so that average model performance is greater than target_performance. If assurance model performance is greater than target performance 80\% of the time.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to run mlpwr with verbose output}

\item{data_function}{A function that returns datasets. Must have a single argmument, n, which controls the sample size.}

\item{model_function}{A function that fits models to the data. Take the data object returned by data_funciton as only argument.}

\item{metric_function}{A function that returns a performance metric. Must take test data, a fitted model and a model function as arguments. Must return a single value.}

\item{value_on_error}{The value used if there is an error in fitting the model or calculating performance.}

\item{n_init}{The number of initial sample sizes simulated before the gausian process search begins.}
