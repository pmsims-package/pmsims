\title{Simulate Custom
'simulate_custom' is the interface for pmsims at the most basic level. It performs no processing of arguments and allows all possible options to be customised.}
\usage{
simulate_custom(
  data_function = NULL,
  model_function = NULL,
  metric_function = NULL,
  target_performance,
  c_statistic,
  mean_or_assurance = "assurance",
  test_n = 30000,
  min_sample_size,
  max_sample_size,
  n_reps_total = NULL,
  n_reps_per = 50,
  se_final = NULL,
  n_init = 4,
  method = "mlpwr",
  verbose = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_function}{A function that returns datasets. Must have a single argmument, n, which controls the sample size.}

\item{model_function}{A function that fits models to the data. Take the data object returned by data_funciton as only argument.}

\item{metric_function}{A function that returns a performance metric. Must take test data, a fitted model and a model function as arguments. Must return a single value.}

\item{target_performance}{The minimum desired model performance}

\item{mean_or_assurance}{Can be either "mean" or "assurance". If mean, sample size is calculated so that average model performance is greater than target_performance. If assurance model performance is greater than target performance 80\% of the time.}

\item{test_n}{The sample size used for test datasets. This should be a large number.}

\item{min_sample_size}{The minimum sample size assessed. This sets the lower bound of the search region for sample size.}

\item{max_sample_size}{The maximum sample size assessed. This sets the upper bound of the search region for sample size.}

\item{n_reps_total}{The total number of simulation reps run by pmsims.}

\item{n_reps_per}{The number of reps run at each sample size.}

\item{se_final}{A standard error which can be used as a stopping criteria. Either n_reps_total or se_final should be given.}

\item{n_init}{The number of initial sample sizes to be used in the search before the algorithm passed in method is used}

\item{method}{The method used to search for the minimum sample size. Options are "mlpwr", "crude" and "ga".}

\item{verbose}{A logical controlling output}

\item{...}{Other argments passed to the method function.}

\item{penalty_weight}{This is the weight that balances the objective and the cost of large sample size for the "ga" engine. Value 0 implies the focus is to minimize the abs difference.}

\item{tol}{This is the minimum difference between performance at i and i+1 for the "bisection" engine, default is 1e-3.}
